	 * {@link StringUtils#getFilenameExtension(String)} on the request URI to accomplish
	 * this. For example a URL like {@code /myController.json} would resolve to a view

	 * and instead simply return a {@link ModelAndView} object for the given name. 
	 * For normal controllers with a configurable view name property, that property can
	 * be passed in here, but usually the value will not be configured.</p>
